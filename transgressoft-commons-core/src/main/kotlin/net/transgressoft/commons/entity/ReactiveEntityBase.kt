/**
 * Abstract base class that provides reactive functionality for entities, enabling them to notify subscribers
 * about property changes through a reactive flow-based pattern.
 *
 * This class implements the [ReactiveEntity] interface and manages subscriptions using Kotlin Flows.
 * When properties of the entity change, all subscribers are automatically notified with both the updated
 * entity state and the previous state.
 *
 * This implementation uses lazy initialization for the event publisher - the publisher infrastructure
 * (channels, flows, and coroutines) is only created when the first subscriber registers. This significantly
 * reduces memory overhead for entities that are never observed, which is especially beneficial in applications
 * with thousands of reactive entities.
 *
 * @param K The type of the entity's unique identifier, which must implement [Comparable]
 * @param R The concrete type of the reactive entity that extends this class
 *
 * @see ReactiveEntity
 * @see MutationEvent
