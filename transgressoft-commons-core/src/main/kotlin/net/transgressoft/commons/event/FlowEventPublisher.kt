/**
 * Class that provides reactive event publishing capabilities using Kotlin coroutine flows.
 *
 * `FlowEventPublisher` implements the core functionality needed for reactive programming by:
 * 1. Managing a [MutableSharedFlow] to broadcast events to multiple subscribers
 * 2. Providing compatibility with both Java's [Flow.Subscriber] API and Kotlin's flow-based approach
 * 3. Supporting suspending functions for asynchronous event handling
 *
 * This class serves as a foundational layer for both entity-level reactivity (property changes)
 * and collection-level reactivity (CRUD operations) within the reactive architecture.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Thread-safe event publication with backpressure handling
 * - Support for both traditional subscribers and modern flow collectors
 * - Coroutine-based asynchronous event processing
 * - Selective event publishing based on event type activation
 *
 * @param E The specific type of [TransEvent] this publisher will emit
 *
 * @see [TransEventPublisher]
 * @see [SharedFlow]
