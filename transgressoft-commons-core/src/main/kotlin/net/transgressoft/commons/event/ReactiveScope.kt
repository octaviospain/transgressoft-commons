/**
 * Centralized manager for coroutine scopes used throughout the reactive system.
 *
 * This singleton object provides standardized coroutine scopes for different types of operations
 * in the reactive framework:
 *
 * - Flow processing: For handling event flows, subscriptions, and reactive updates
 * - I/O operations: For file access, serialization, and other potentially blocking operations
 *
 * By centralizing scope management, ReactiveScope ensures:
 * 1. Consistent behavior across the reactive system
 * 2. Proper resource utilization with controlled parallelism
 * 3. Easy configuration for testing with test dispatchers
 * 4. Clean cancellation of ongoing operations when needed
 *
 * The default scopes use limited parallelism to prevent resource exhaustion while
 * maintaining responsive operation.
